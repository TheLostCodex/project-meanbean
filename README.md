## Project Meanbean

This repository contains our working code for "Project Meanbean". This is meant to be a naive implementation of a simple game using the NCurses library to help implement a simple GUI that runs in a terminal environment.

# Utilities

## Test Compatibility

In the `/utilities` directory, you can run the command: `make`.

# Sandbox

## Character Movement

In the `/sandbox/character_movement` directory, you can run the command: `make`

This shows the character `@` moving leaving a trail of `#` characters in spaces that were visited.

## Map Generation and Traversal

In the `/sandbox/map` directory, you can run the command: `make`

This shows the character `@` moving throughout the map and the viewport staying focused on the main character. As the character moves it leaves blank characters in spaces that were visted.
